# VanHack Sao Paulo Mission - 2019

## Traction Guest Challenge - Smart Spot

### Traction Hack BR Team
Antonio Matos - DevOps  
Natasha dos Reis - QA  
Luiz de Paula - Ruby Backend Developer  

### Idea
Since we couldn't find details on how the Traction Guest Parking Lot module works, we put together a very simple checkin/checkout flow.  
  
The idea is, after the checkin process in the parking lot entrance, the guest receives a SMS message (or email) containing the spot number he/she is supposed to park.  
  
When the guest checks out, another SMS is sent, thanking for the visit, and providing a link to a parking lot map, with the spot highlited. That way, guest can easily find the automobile.

### Folders
docs: contains both flows (checkin/checkout) documented  
qa: contains the test case scenarios that should be tested  
src: contains the code (Ruby on Rails)  
devops: contains details on the DevOps process to deploy the application
